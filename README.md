PBFT Protocol State
=============================

Toy library to abstract the protocol-state/control-flow of a PBFT node of a generic p2p application.
It abstracts over the network, crypto primitives and application-specific-logic; given them one should be able to implement a wide range of
p2p applications such file-sharing software or crypto-currencies...that said, __this is a toy library__, with a purely educational purpose.
